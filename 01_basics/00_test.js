// also whatever youre saving here is not getting saved to your git so you have to fork it to your account.
// press on fork icon<select the files you want to push into your repo<type a msg (rn i typed "container config done")
// then click on three dots next to sourcecontrol and select "push". TADA!
// now if you wannt to run them on your system- just download the zip folder lalala


// fyi we can use script tag in html too but only where js is needed very less otherwise we make separate js files. 
// why? for optimization of your website. js files are downloaded and saved in the cache of the site, so to
// save ourselves from downloading same material in different pages its better to do that only once. reduces traffic.
// plus makes website way faster.
// TO CONNECT JS TO HTML WE USE <script src> tag!!

// so you must've seen "use-strict" directive at the top. basically after ES5(ECMA script, 2009)- there were a lot
// of changes that happened in js lang so to write in 'modern' javascript we use use-script. BUT COMMAND HAS TO BE AT
// TOP OR ELSE IT WORK WORK!!! (or inside functions at top, in function-level scope)
