// general knowledge about js:
// js is synchronous in default but can become async by performing some operations
// js is single threaded: it can only execute one piece of code at a time
// its is slow but its not used on js runtime engine, its mostly used on browser or node engine
// execution flows synchronously, each operation waits for last one to fiish before executing next one
