// general knowledge about js:
// js is synchronous in default but can become async by performing some operations
// js is single threaded: it can only execute one piece of code at a time
// its is slow but its not used on js runtime engine, its mostly used on browser or node engine
// execution flows synchronously, each operation waits for last one to fiish before executing next one

// to make a code async we have two js callbacks: setInterval(for one time), 
// setTimeout(for repeating after a few secs), or fetch()
// async, wait
// promises(finishes in future, eg encryption)

// theres two types of tasks: blocking tasks and non-blocking tasks
// depending upon use case we avail both, if we need non-blocks we use async programs
